# Kaku

A text rendering crate for rust+wgpu, using signed distance fields for rendering.

This crate was originally designed with the intent of allowing fast frame-by-frame rendering of outlined text for a video game I'm working on. I intend to expand it to provide many of the features enabled by SDF rendering.
